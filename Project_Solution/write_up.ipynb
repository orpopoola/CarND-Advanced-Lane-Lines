    "### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration code was given in the example template for the project. I did not substantially change the code but applied it in calibration. To use it, I generated objpoints and imgpoints whice are used to apply distortion correction by using the cv2.undistort() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Application  of distortion correction\n",
    "Distortion correction is carried out by applying the generated objpoints and imgpoints in the previous section to the test images using the cv2.undistort(img,camMat,distCoef,None, camMat) function where the input arguments to the function are generated as outputs of the cv2.calibrateCamera() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a combination of HLS, gradient and magnitude transforms in threshold finding. To make the process easier, I designed a GUI tool for this purpose. The GUI tool made easy iteration while changing values for the transforms. The transforms I wrote in this section are the Sobel transform, magnitude, direction, hls and rgb transforms. Although, I wrote the 5, using my GUI tool I was able to get acceptable results using just 4 (the first four).\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this process, I had to define a region of interest to help with the thresholding. Although, the pipeline worked well without the region of interest, but the video was distorted when a black car was passing because the car was highly reflective. In order to address this, I modified the region of interest function given to us in the first project by udacity and used it to remove the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of images after thresholding can be found in the output_images/thresh_images folder\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of the bad video output (without region of interest function) is included in the Project_solution/project_video_out_noROI_30_40s.mp4. The effect of no region of interest can be seen between 30 and 40s of the video\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `generate_warped(img,objpoints,imgpoints)`, which uses the objpoints ad imgpoints from the calibration step.  The `generate_warped` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), and uses source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points which I generated within the function.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "src =  np.float32([[(250,720),(565, 475),(755, 475), (1150,720)]])\n",
    "    dst =  np.float32([[300,720],[300,100],[900,100],[900,720]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in the following source and destination points:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source        | Destination   | \n",
    "|:-------------:|:-------------:| \n",
    "| 250,720      | 300,720       | \n",
    "|565, 475      | 300,100     |\n",
    "|755, 475    | 900,100      |\n",
    "| 1150,720     | 900,720      |\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was to map the warped source points to a perfect rectangle on the destination\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images from the warping check can be found in the output_images/warped_images folder\n",
    "#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I modified the find_lanes_pixels() function which uses the output of the generate_warped() function. The output of the function provided values to the leftx, lefty, rightx, righty, and out_img variables. Using these variables and the fit_polynomial, the left and right fits were computed. A pipeline was written to test this process and the output are presented in the output_images/fitted_images folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "As advised in the tutorial, this process was effectively carried out using a search_around_poly() function and a pipeline was written to observe the output\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this using the measure_curvature_real() function. In the function, I implemented the real world computation of the radius of curvature as applied in the tutorial video. To observe the computed radius of curvature, I wrote a pipeline (pipeline3()) for this purpose. I initially got wrong curvature values and had to modify my code to ensure the values are within acceptable ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented a couple of functions here and they are\n",
    "    1. draw_polygon(): this function was used to draw a polygon on a blacked form of the sample image. the polygon lines are based on the polynomial fit for both left and right derived in previous section\n",
    "    2. merge_images(): This function is from the first project of the course where we used weighted variable to place the unwarped polygon on the original image. By unwarped I mean a reverse of the initial warping function implemented using generate_warped(). This is carried out using a generate_unwarp() function explained below\n",
    "    3. add_text(): The purpose of this function was to add text to specific parts of the image using the cv2.putText() function\n",
    "    4. generate_unwarp(): This function reversered the initial perspective transform done my generate_warped\n",
    "    \n",
    " I wrote a final pipeline for this process and the outputs are stored in the output_images/final_images folder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline (video)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_out.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the region of interest function made the pipeline more robust and stopped the process from being errorneous when the black (highly reflective) car was passing by.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging part I faced during this project was drawing the polygon. It was difficult to implement the cv2.fitPoly() function. I had lots of errors and had to check the udacity student hub. I found students with similar problems and saw how were advised to overcome them. I tried a few of the solutions and was able to solve the problem I faced,\n"
